# My SwiftUI Learning Journey

I have recently started learning **SwiftUI** to build modern, elegant, and efficient iOS applications.  
Step by step, I am improving my skills and exploring new concepts in mobile app development.

## 📚 Current Focus
- Understanding SwiftUI syntax and structure
- Learning navigation, layouts, and data handling
- Implementing Firebase for backend services
- Following best practices for clean and maintainable code

## 🚀 Goals
- Build fully functional iOS apps using SwiftUI
- Integrate real-world features such as authentication, database, and push notifications
- Publish my first app to the App Store

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- SwiftUI
- Xcode
- Firebase
- Swift Package Manager (SPM)

## ✨ Notes
This repository will serve as my personal learning playground where I experiment, make mistakes, and improve with every commit.  
I believe in **learning by doing**, so I’ll be creating mini-projects along the way.
